0,8 February 2020,"Great location, pool area a huge plus , good dining",9.2,"Great location, pool area a huge plus , good dining",Bedroom very bland . No soft furnishings. Too little furniture in a big space . Uncomfortable couch area and needs colour or inventive design to make you want to spend any time in the bedroom. Hotel could do with a residents bar for a relaxing drink after dinner . Sitting in a closed off section in the lobby with AC is not a bar . Nobody minds the tour groups but deliver more for your guests.,Deirdre,Ireland,February 2020

2,6 February 2020,Not worth the money,7.1,"Location and the view are the key factors to staying here.  You won’t get a better view of the city, bay or ocean.","The price was ridiculous I paid about $1000/night  for a high floored room thinking I would be pampered and have the ultimate experience.  Sadly the staff and accommodations let us down.
Freeze dried coffee and powdered milk for in room coffee options
No bidet on toilet.
No remote for the window dressings
Basic TV services and a remote control that barely worked.
No smart TV options
Minibar wasn’t updated everyday
NOT ONCE did the front of house staff open a door!
I got charged $5 for cucumber that were presented to the table as a free amuse bouche at Blossom restaurant.",Lenny,USA,February 2020
3,5 February 2020,If you liked Crazy Rich Asians then stay here,8.8,"Out of this world hotel. We stayed one night as it is expensive and also not that convenient location to walking around Singapore. The first 4 nights we stayed in a more central area so we could walk. The Gardens by the Bay are right there so one night we watched from below which is free and then watched the light show from our room the next night. The infinity pool is very cool. The night club was not so great. No place to sit, no one was dancing. Yes, the place is pricey but it was all about the experience which was worth it for one night.",It could have been cheaper.

Old crap materials, 2 old computers having XP still and old windows 7, no possible to work or update with normal business standards. Poor small room out of the building, very incovenient and really a local internet cafe would look better. Services there overpriced compared to equipment and location. Would never use it for sure if known before. Expectations high because of excellent hotel staff and locations, but the business section is an absolite NO GO for interntational travelers that need a business center.",Barbara,Switzerland,February 2020

9,3 February 2020,Phenomenal,9.2,"Marina Bay Sands certainly knows how to welcome/pamper its guests and make them feel special. I have informed the hotel before arrival that we are coming for our honeymoon, so they were kind enough to put us in a room with the Garden View which was an amazing gesture.. it really made our trip. Not just that, they even sent us 2 towels embroidered with with our names which was superb. I highly recommend the hotel and its buffet.. it is phenomenal, the diversity and quality of food is EXCELLENT!!!!","The pool menu and service, it is very crowded. a beautiful hotel like this needs to have a more luxurious menu/service by the pool.",Roulla,Egypt,December 2019

11,3 February 2020,"Overall, MBS was far far below my expectation for a super 5-star hotel.  Don't consider MBS hotel!!!",4.2,Nothing!,"The room price was extremely high (Singapore $1,000 or HK$5,800 per night!) but the services and facilities were far far below the standard for such a high price.  During check-in, although the staff was quite friendly, she did not inform me about the choice of rooms available to me and arranged a room facing the shopping mall instead of the garden.  She only gave me room key cards for adults but my kids could not enter to the swimming pool without the cards.  I was not informed at the check-in counter that the mini bar had been installed a wave sensor and I would be charged SG$177 if I moved the items stored in the mini bar!  I had to spend 15 minutes to argue with the check-out staff to dispute such unreasonable charge as I did not consume anything in the mini bar and I had to move the items because the mini bar was also a fridge and I had to store something in the fridge by taking out some items from the fridge and then putting them back later.  Although the swimming pool at the top roof was good, the quality of water was bad, the cleanliness around the swimming pool was bad, the attitude of the staff working in the swimming pool was very rough.  MBS Hotel was really bad and far far below my expectation.  I shall not stay in this hotel in the future again and I definitely do not recommend it to all other customers.",Ka,Hong Kong,January 2020
12,2 February 2020,"Great view, service can be improved",6.3,"This is our second time there. The first time we were underwhelmed by the room and the service. We were there for our honeymoon but they didn't bother preparing something extra special at all, which was a disappointment. This time, the lady at the check in counter was much nicer. We were upgraded to a room with a spectacular view which made the stay much more worthwhile.","The furniture and decor seems a bit outdated. In our huge room, there were no furniture occupying half the room which felt like wasted space. Service is hit or miss, and check in queues can be very long.",Anonymous,Canada,January 2020
13,2 February 2020,Casino resort more than a luxury hotel - absolutely not worth the price,5.8,The spa area is very large and nice for pictures,Genuinely terrible value for money. We could hear loud music from downstairs from the room until past midnight. Restaurants are not worth the price and one refused to serve us because one of our friends was wearing mid-length pants (I have never seen a dress code like this even in world-class restaurants). The hotel itself is too big and feels more like a massive resort than anything resembling a luxury hotel.,Anonymous,Chile,February 2020

15,2 February 2020,Recommend a visit but not to stay.,6.3,"On my bucket list was to stay in this hotel, and yes its an engineering marvel. I asked for a room on a higher floor but didn't get it. The manager actually phoned me up which was a nice surprise.","Its a large impersonal place. Too busy to relax. Full of transient people and the pool full of people taking selfies. Takes 3 lifts to get to the pool, which are shared with the transient visitors. The pool was cold. The bar at the top provided no service so couldn't get a drink and relax. The sun beds are all 'taken' so little chance of actually enjoying the pool during the day. The water display is not a patch on the Bellagio, Vegas. I'd suggest staying somewhere else and visiting.",John,New Zealand,January 2020

Location is excellent where assist to any transportation and connecting to major sight location by walk ( garden by the bay and art science museum.,Nothing we don’t like. It’s perfect,Iris,Hong Kong,February 2020
17,1 February 2020,A good five start hotel but overpriced(almost double the price) during the holiday season,8.3,"Stayed two nights.. Rooms are very good with almost everything available within hotel, the shopping mall attached and other attractions at walking distance. Apart from rooms and pool, hotel is not that beautiful from inside. sort of typical five start hotel.
For the infinity pool, its very good and awesome views. But during the day, pool is full of people and kids, all beach chairs occupied.. We did not bother going to the pool during the day as you cannot enjoy at all.. its like a public pool. The best time is to go to pool early in the morning(7am), only few people, beautiful sunrise views,  you can swim, enjoy the pool and views as well.",,Farrukh,Australia,January 2020
18,31 January 2020,Disappointing.,6.3,The views from the roof and roof top pool were very good.,"The rooftop pool too crowded.  The hotel ""lobby"" was a public concourse.  No members of staff to meet and greet, very impersonal hotel.",Ruth,United Kingdom,January 2020
19,31 January 2020,Great for 1 night,8.8,"Let’s face it, the hotel is amazing but we went there only for the pool.","Waiting 1 hour for check-in was a big joke. 
Overall for the services provided, the price is way too high. You don’t even have breakfast, while if you go in a hostel or a guesthouse in any part of Singapore, you pay 20 times cheaper and get breakfast (it’s what we did). It is kind of ridiculous and disappointing for a hotel of such scale. Worst value for money.
So yeah, enjoy the pool and the view for 1 day, take photos and then move on :)",Anonymous,Switzerland,January 2020

Pool was great to refresh after the heat of exploring Singapore. 
Lots of things walking distance to hotel or MRT station really close for those that don’t like walking.  
Entertaining to watch all the ridiculous ‘instagraming’ in and around the pool.","It’s a really big hotel where you are completely anonymous. Had absolutely no interaction with staff except in policing access to pool. 
We didn’t have breakfast because $53 pp seemed excesssive. Plus here were massive lines. Would be interested to see if it would be worth having. 
Room nothing special, but did the trick. Could have been a room in any mid-priced hotel around the world. Aircon was very noisey.

2) Checking out - incredulous unsuccessful wait of 25min for a lift to get down (tried to go up as well as down but all the lifts were crazy full; we were at level 48). Went back to room to call to notify we will b late for check out but they arrange a staff to come up n bring us down via the service/staff lift - kudos for recognising the need for a flexible solution. 
3) room service was good , from making orders, arranging delivery time and delivery/set up
4) good touch to provide water, fruit punch, ice cream at the long queue of check in. 
Though, should b consistent when checking out which had long queue too","1) checking out - ridiculous wait for lift of 25min, lost count how many lifts were full. Both directions up or down were just too full. At level 48. We were not the only ones trying to get down to check out. 
2) bed was too soft / used too much - sinking on one side much much more. Uneven hardness/surface. Not a pleasant sleep

After waiting in the long queue to check in, they asked us if we wanted to carry our bags to the room or if we needed assistance to do it. Maybe it was because we were carrying backpacks. When at the sauna, a staff member told us we couldn't lay on our backs in the sauna, we should be sited only (even though there was nobody else at the sauna and plenty of room).

We did have an issue with drilling outside the room which was very annoying as we wanted a rest.  We did ring down to reception to complain ( which we never do).  This was swiftly resolved.  We was offered a room change but was informed that the drilling would only be another 30 mins so we declined this gesture and thought we would just deal with the noise. Then to our amazement we received another call offering us a bar tab in the cocktail bar for $50 This was greatly appreciated.  The first round of cocktails were amazing so we decided to have another and another and another.  When we asked to pay our bill for the additional drinks we had ordered and expected to pay for we was informed that the whole bill would be settled for us.   This was totally expected and greatly received.   
We spent the rest of our evening around the hotel and this was a great experience in all restaurants and bars.

And when we arrived at the hotel, we were met by one of the staff who took us to the checkout-in lounge instead of the regular check-in desk. There she arranged for immediate access to our rooms, although it was only 9 am while check-in is at 3 pm. That was highly welcome after a long flight. 
Our luggage was lost and we had to re-arrange our travel plans for the next day, and not only did the hotel arrange for a change in our airport transfer, but we also got late check-out and could keep the room until our departure! This was an unexpected perk, which gave us the possibility to sleep in and rest before our onward travel.
Both macrons and a birthday cake was delivered to our room during the day, with compliments of the hotel as the staff had noticed when registering our passports that it was my husbands birthday four days later.
We had two connecting rooms, which was really nice when traveling with teenagers. The rooms were spacious and with large balconies with view on Gardens by the Bays.

You definitely feel like you’re part of an exclusive club up there and made the cost all worthwhile.","The only downside for me was that the bed was a little too firm and the pillows were also pretty flat. For the price you pay (SGD$1300 for 2 nights) I was expecting luxury bedding, instead I found the bed quite uncomfortable and would wake with a sore neck/back.",Kelly,Australia,November 2019

Very clean and beautiful. (It’s probably why the room prices are so high, because the room itself isn’t necessarily worth that much).
Although, the room was very comfortable and big with good amenities and great bathroom. 
The hotel spa was small (but always nice to have) and the infinity pool is unbelievable.
You also get discounts to shops in the mall and to the science and art museum when you show your room key which is nice.
We were on the 15th floor and had a beautiful view of the gardens with lights shows visible from the balcony which was awesome (even if I definitely recommend going to it to experience it, way more impressive!!)","The room was noisy, we could hear the road a lot which was annoying when you pay so much! We were on the 15th floor so we can’t imagine what it would have been if we had been lower!!
They definitely should/could have soundproofed the windows more.
The restaurants were all overpriced (as you can expect) but soooo overpriced! I mean even room service was cheap in comparaison. (2 glasses of wines at Lavo cost us 55$) we definitely didn’t expect that! Also they have 17% tax on everything, so the price you see, is NOT the price you will pay.",Audrey,Belgium,November 2019

The roof top infinity pool (for hotel guests only) with expansive views was lovely to retreat to. The Club room felt like an apartment it was so spacious and well appointed with electric drapes and a sitting room.","We booked a Club room and whilst the room itself was amazing we were a little disappointed in the Club itself. After staying at another hotel prior to MBS where the Club was intimate, quiet and exclusive we were taken back by the ‘Bistro’ ambience of the MBS Club 55. The staff, food and drinks were fabulous but regularly sitting next to crying babies and young children misbehaving and throwing the sugar packets on the ground was not ideal and took the shine away.  It did not feel like the luxurious and exclusive Club in the sky overlooking one of the most prettiest cities in the world that we were expecting given the price tag.....instead it was like ‘family night at the local’ for the rich.",Lyneece,Australia,September 2019

463,19 September 2019,Classy and homely,9.6,"Marina Bay Sands is located in a beautiful building. We were in the lower rise rooms, at level 5, with a view of the gardens. The room was very big (we got given a family room with a double bed in a master room and an extra pull out sofa bed in a separate area). The master bedroom was an ensuite, with the bathroom also being very large, it included; a shower, bathtub, toilet and 2 sinks. There was an extra room near the entrance with just a toilet and sink which was also nice. We had two TV’s and a large desk with chair. As well as an extra table in the first room (this could be used to even have a coffee or tea in the morning). Alternatively, there was a table on the very large balcony that followed through from the first room area across to the master bedroom. The room was clean and all amenities were provided (bath salts was a nice extra touch). 
The pool was stunning, unfortunately we could not appreciate the view as much as desired due to the high PSI level. However, this was not MBS’ fault. Additionally, even though we did not use the gym, we went to view it and despite not being immensely large, there’s a lot of equipment available for use. We also did not get to use the SPA but it looked lovely too.
The staff was very friendly and the restaurants inside, although on the pricey side as imaginable, had a few options. With the choice of walking just a few minutes to the Marina Bay Sands mall. We had dinner at a buffet restaurant located in the hotel. I would say it was a good choice, with kind staff that recommended signing up for the free Marina Bay Sands Rewards card to enjoy a discount starting from that meal. 
Overall, I would say our stay was great and we only wish we had more time there.","We got our check out time fortunately pushed back to 12PM rather than 11AM, which was greatly appreciated. However, if there was anything to comment on, I would just say it would be nice to still be able to access the pool and other such facilities after check out, till the end of that day.

The lobby area is super crowded at all times, and is far from intimate. You may also be waiting for an elevator for a long time, depending which floor you're on. The infinity pool and deck on the roof are amazing, but the rooms are just okay for the price. The ""Deluxe King Room"" had a great view, but was otherwise pretty small compared to hotels / resorts at a similar price level. We had also stayed at the Ritz nearby which had a much bigger King room - with a separate lounge area and a huge bathroom for $100 less per night. What you're paying for here is the pool and the Sands resort complex, which offers plenty of entertainment, shopping and dining options.

All staff members were very friendly, positive and accommodating.","Signage was a bit confusing to get to pool area as You need to take 2 diff elevators to get there and there are no bathrooms on that floor.  You have to go back down one floor to access bathrooms.  Inconvenient as well. 
You need your passport to get into the casino. Forgot mine in the room safe.  No passport, no entrance.  Ugh. 
Guests of the hotel should get a discount on the Gardens by the Bay activities or a free entrance to something.  There doesn’t seem to be any exclusive reason to stay at hotel besides location to activities. 
Early check-in was not possible even though I asked weeks in advance.  I get it, but still.  Plus, while I had to wait for few hours for my room to be available, I never received an email stating my room was ready as was told.  I had to ask service workers to check for me.  I don’t understand that days before, management sent me emails asking when I wanted to check-in and check-out and yet they didn’t have my email on file to alert me when my room was ready?  Not good.  Since I had to check-out so early the next day (05:30) I thought maybe some consideration would be given as to if I could check in a couple hours early.  Plan but no execution.

512,6 September 2019,Amazing experience for a special occasion,9.6,"MBS is an experience. We chose to do a 3 night stopover in Singapore before heading on the New Zealand. We decided on MBS because it was my partners birthday and because the infinity pool is absolutely fantastic. Everything was perfect - we elected to upgrade from the bottom room to the next level and the room size was honestly huge (it's bigger than our apartment in London). The bathroom was enormous, the toilet and shower had their own 'rooms' in the bathroom as well as a tub. The bed was very comfortable and the floor space very large for a hotel room. The front desk staff were also kind enough to organize a little cake for my partners birthday and had it brought up when we came back to the room for the evening. 
We chose the Sky Tree view and it was really impressive, you look our over the harbor and can watch all the boats as well as see the Sky Trees at night which is really nice. Obviously the pool is incredible, we had many late night swims which was awesome in the heat and the poolside service is relatively quick. 
Shout-out to the reception staff on front desk who gave us a great floor - we were on the 35th floor which means you don't have to change elevators to go to the pool. It's definitely worth asking the check in desk if you can have a room that doesn't require you to change lifts to head to the pool as the lifts do get quite busy. 
Very happy we stayed at MBS. When we next go back to Singapore we'll likely stay at a slightly less expensive hotel but for a special occasion it was 100% worth the money.","Overall the hotel is genuinely incredible.

It was very nice when we first checked-in before it got crowded, but it was not worth what we paid for the hotel. Within an hour, the pool became VERY CROWDED, and it was difficult to take pictures without other people in them.","We quickly learned that nothing at the Marina Bay Sands is either free or inexpensive. Not only did we pay a small fortune for just one night at the hotel, we spent almost $200 (USD) on just two meals for two of us by the pool. The poolside menu also did not offer much variety, so we were basically spending a lot of money on food that we settled for and was just okay. We also didn't like how strict the hotel's policies were. We requested extra time in the pool after check-out, but again, the Marina Bay Sands gives nothing away for free, and we were denied. Even though the Marina Bay Sands operates in the hospitality industry, there is not much hospitality. They know that people will pay to stay there for the name itself, so they don't need to offer anything extra. We we were glad we only booked one night, and we will probably never return. It's just not worth the money. Our other hotel in Singapore offered so much more. The other hotel offered all kind of free benefits, and they went over and above for us, helping us with anything and everything we could possibly need to make sure that we had a great stay.

The hotel got to know me and my wife had our anniversary while staying there so they took extra measures to decorate our room accordingly and sent us a delicious gift to celebrate us! Thank you again!
I chose a room with a city view. The view from the room was nothing but magnificent, daytime as well as nighttime. The room is also clean, spacious and tastefully furnished. The bed is big, perfect softness to hardness ratio and the sheets are smooth and soft. 
The hotel is connected with a huge mall where you can find all brands and products you could want. Just make sure to get the Sands Rewards Lifestyle membership for free to get discounts and collect points. There is also nice restaurants and a food court. 
The hotel is located right on top of the MRT station (Bayfront) so traveling to any place or attraction in the city is fast and convenient.

Instead of a welcome drink or any friendly greeting we were confronted with rather unfriendly personnel in bad English, taking 30 minutes of tapping on the keyboard and making phone calls to then finally hand us over the room keys. Generally the personnel is not attentive nor helpful but rather pushing and unfriendly.
For the price we paid the room was very simple and used up. There was no balcony but sliding doors which did not properly close and let in the noise of the highway below. The TV channels were interrupted randomly. The fact of having button controlled curtains rather complicated the usage than make up for the rest of the low room quality.
Breakfast for 53SGD per person was available on the ground floor inside tower 1 (Rise) or tower 2 (Adrift) and was not worth the money: The food quality was low and without taste, and the fact of the open restaurants in the lobby gave the impression of sitting in a noisy shopping mall rather than a restaurant.
The worldwide well known pool on the roof top is not inviting to relax and enjoy, as the quality of the chairs and towels is low and the pool is over-crowded with people making pictures and walking everywhere. We tried to eat lunch at the adjacent restaurant and were disappointed from the quality and size of the food as well. The personnel is not attentive and rather rude.

Overall - very good. The CUT restaurant located in the attached shopping mall (3-4 min walk from the lobby) was VERY GOOD.","There are no complains about staff/location/service. But it is a BIG HOTEL (probably, the biggest here), so you shouldn't expect personalized treatment, available at the other 5*s for the same and even less money.

814,7 June 2019,"Amazing Pool, Check-In Process Was Cumbersome",7.1,"You’ve probably heard this many times before, but the Infinity Pool is incredible. The views over Singapore at dawn, during the day, and dusk are incredible. It really is a case of “seeing is believing” as the videos or pictures you see just don’t do it justice. Proximity to Gardens by the Bay, the light show in front of the hotel each evening, the fact the hotel is opposite the Merlion, close to B-Boat stations and the massive connected malls are all pluses. The call center for queries were prompt in answering calls and very helpful, and the room service staff were excellent.","The check-in process I (no joke) endures took approx. 15 minutes. I was waiting in the queue to be called, and no one acknowledged me for some time. I thought this may have been because they could not see me (the check-in area is huge), so I proceeded to walk up to an employee that was free. I was told “I usually call people when ready, as you can see now I am not ready”, which I felt was not only rude but unbecoming of a 5 star hotel. 
I was subsequently told they could not find me a room as it was busy (despite booking weeks in advance), so the receptionist (Diva) chatted to her colleague while ignoring both my wife and I.
That started the stay on a very bad note. Comparing the hotel with other 5 star hotels I have stayed in within the Middle East and Europe, the prices charged are excessive. The Infinity Pool is a great perk, but the pool area is VERY messy. Also, the lobby area is always crowded, and this makes the hotel seem more like a theme park at times rather than a welcoming hotel that you literally pay top dollar for.
Would I stay here again? I would say only possibly if it was a very special occasion. There is definitely better value out there in Singapore, and most certainly better receptionists for check-in.",Frederick,United Arab Emirates,June 2019

The table next to me was a couple who didn't even stay at the hotel, but got to start a tab ? A bit of an awkward yet unfortunate experience.

For breakfast we opted for the buffet at Spago, but after eating there, we thought that Rise would be a better choice.

Very nice it was possible to make use of the shower facilities in the evening after check out","Lobby and entree is a very busy and not only restricted to hotel guests, but there are loads of non guest tourist, conference / business men, casino visitors etc. It gives the feeling this is a multipurpose building which accidentally also has hotel rooms to offer.
We got the feeling the have a lot of free-runners, so there are highly keen on keeping deposit on your credit card, multiple times check these an block you access to your room once you exceed this. This happened to us and I actually never encountered this in a hotel.
Carpets in the building and rooms need to be replaced, a lot of stains and ware + quite smelly
The Internet was extremely slow and I was very surprised that after paying 400 euro a night I need to pay extra for fast internet? This is something you cannot do anymore in a five star hotel in 2019 if you target also guests from Europe where this is 10 year already not common practice to charge internet at all.
We had diner at two restaurants at the skypark:
Spago: Staff are very attentive and friendly! Food is good, but not of michelin quality - just ok. The portions are seriously small, I was mistaken my tuna entree with a amuse bouche ... This given also a very high price brings it completely out of balance. I would not return her, there are so many places in town which offer better value.
CELAVIE - This experience was definitely worse than Spago. The interior is nice, but there is lots of noise from the outside bar. Staff is rather rushed and your need to actually ask for everything: service is very slow. Food is ok, but nothing special. Reservations and seating are all handled by a very arrogant ""doorbitch"".

I had many firsts in this hotel: consistently waiting for 20min to receive a drink because of the number of guests, I was not allowed to leave the bar until they checked my room number and name (implying that I am lying) and as a final screw you, u are not allowed to use any amenities after your check out. If ur plane is in the evening, they dont care u cant use the pool or anything else. When I complained about it the concierge told me I am allowed to store baggage after checkout.

I wasn’t told I needed a passport to enter the casino so I had left it in my room and it took awhile to go and come back and get in line again. I didn’t like that on Tower 2 entrance it says Casino but then doesn’t have Casino access. I paid extra to have Marina and city view and they gave me a high level garden view and said it was the same... so that wasn’t cool, although the garden view is quite nice but it is cheaper. I reserved dinner at Lavo on a Friday night and the food was just so so at best and the champagne bottle came hot and I had to wait for 30 minutes to chill as they wouldn’t replace it.

The location, though not in the thick of things, is still very close and the MRT station underneath makes it easy enough to get wherever you need/want to go. The Skypark and rooftop infinity pool are all you could hope for, the latter only accessible to guests. We had a club level room with a city view. Club55 offered a great breakfast and evening cocktails (an afternoon tea, as well, which we missed).","Even though we had asked in writing beforehand, and then again at check-in, if we could use the pool after checking out, we were nearly unable to experience the pool. We had an evening flight and thought we’d enjoy the pool at the end of our stay. When we went to checkout, we were told using the pool was no longer available. The problem is that we had explicitly asked and been told we could turn in our room key for a temporary. The staff were insistent that we were mistaken and wouldn’t budge. They did offer an extra hour, 1/2 of which was wasted arguing. When we insisted on the manager viewing the CCTV tapes of our check-in, the tape was mysteriously missing and they finally offered us what had been promised.

All of that sounded fine, although crowded, which unfortunately it was. The fold out sofa bed however was completely substandard for a 5 star property. The mattress springs were pushing through and made it impossible to have a decent night sleep on. My Daughter ended up sleeping on the the sofa cushions “on top of the bed”. Given the rating of this hotel, this is unacceptable and, if nothing else, that bed should be replaced.

1073,1 April 2019,"Impressive resort, the pool delivers on its promise, but not the best way to experience Singapore.",7.5,"The pool is as impressive as promised, though no one swims in it - its sole purpose seems to be an ""instagrammable"" experience, and that is evident by the constant churn of cameraphone wielding couples vying for space at the edge to capture the appearance of luck and good fortune. I'm guilty of the same. The staff were helpful, and I'm especially grateful to the room attendant for their attention to our comfort. The air conditioning is ample and delightful amounts of sunlight. The architecture and the atmosphere really do scream luxury and modernity, and there is no denying the impressive work done to create such a beautiful space.","Breakfast at Rise was comprehensive, but overpriced for the quality of food, still worth trying once. The entire hotel carries the feeling of a casino-centered resort, and if you're not into that vibe, it's probably not for you. That said, Singapore as a whole carries a similar sense of a place of red lines that must not be crossed, so the hotel property is not alone in the sense that one must always be aware of one's surroundings and their expectations. The hotel is far from Singapore's more pedestrian neighborhoods, so you'll be taking taxis often to experience local culture, bars, restaurants and such. The heat and humidity inspired my friend and I to reluctantly venture out, and it's clear that if you wish to experience ""Singapore"" you'll either need to stay somewhere more central or be more deliberate in your excursions. Mass transit stops underneath the hotel, so a motivated person can find relatively manageable access to the city's further regions. We did not try it in our short stay. 3 days in Singapore is enough, perhaps, to take in the salient points, but only if you venture forth from the resort. If you're looking to be pampered during a multi-day layover, though, this resort is probably the best on offer, but be prepared to pay handsomely. The mall is impressive, but impractical if you need a swimsuit, there are just two boutiques with swimwear and one of them has a tiny selection.",Billie,USA,March 2019

1076,31 March 2019,An iconic hotel that's expensive but definitely worth it for the pool alone.,9.6,"So the first question everyone wants to know is...""Is it worth the money"". And I'd have to say yes it is. We treated ourselves, after a lot of deliberation, to three nights and Im glad to say I would definitely recommend it.
The room was huge (we had a king city view on the 30th floor) and the skyline view at night was stunning. The floor to ceiling windows allow you to just sit and watch the goings on outside and that alone felt really special. Of course it's all about the pool and it really is spectacular. An early morning or late evening swim is a very special experience and it's this that you're really paying the money for. You will remember it forever.
The hotel itself is in a perfect position and is linked to both the gardens by the bay on one side and the huge shopping centre/casino/harbour on the other. It is very well thought out and makes getting around an absolute breeze.
It isn't a glamorous, colonial, historic hotel like the Fullerton or Raffles so if you wanted something more that style then you'd be best looking elsewhere.

1080,30 March 2019,Great views but feels impersonal,7.5,"The view from our room was just breathtaking, and given this is why we wanted to stay here it didn't disappoint.
The infinity pool was awesome too, but very very busy. The beds are so close, and there are so many people who just go up to see the view and take photos that it felt hectic and transient rather than relaxing. But the view is amazing.","The hotel was so huge that it felt pretty impersonal. The fact that there was no lobby or central point to the hotel contributed to this, as you came out of the lift and straight into the retail area. The staff at check in/out were perfectly polite and professional, but the whole set up lacked the warmth of most hotels. Maybe that's normal for this type of hotel.
On the day we checked out we had a really late flight. While there was a secure luggage facility, it was in a room outside the main building. In one way this made sense as it was conveniently next to the taxi rank, but on the other hand it very much felt that once you'd checked out the hotel wasn't interested any more. There were a couple of showers in the gym that you could use, and while these were nice there wasn't much room and they were miles from the luggage facility. As there was no lounge or lobby, there was nowhere to do that final bit of luggage juggling once you'd had your shower. For the money it cost to stay here, I'd have expected much more consideration and better facilities for guests with late flights.
Also, you can only use the rooftop pool until you check out - so if you have a late flight then you'll have to find something else to do. I can see that the hotel needs to do this as there are a lot of guests and the pool area was really busy, but it wasn't what I was expected and it was pretty disappointing.",Jenni,United Kingdom,March 2019

Also the infinity pool is impressive.,"I paid 1200dollars per night for the Orchid Suite and it was lost money because the service was zero (what I understand, because in the hotel you are only a number):
- arriving at the lobby, there were so many people that I had to carry my luggage by myself to my room
- 3 days I tried to find a free seat at the beautiful infinity pool, but unfortunately...
- Also in C'est la vie bar it was not possible to find a seat. There was place enough, but only for members or on reservation, not for guests who pay 1200 dollars per night
- The check-out is at 11am but as I had my plane in the evening, I asked if I can use the swimmingpool. Off course the answer was ""no"". The policy of the hotel is: you pay and get the f... off then because the next guest is waiting.

The room was large but just like any other Hilton/Marriott in terms of design.  Nothing special.  Be prepared to wait in long lines...to check in, get a taxi, get into the elevator that leads to the Gardens by the Bay, etc.  Stay one night to experience the pool, then find a cheaper hotel elsewhere to experience the real Singapore.  I highly recommend ParkRoyal on Pickering :)",Monica,USA,February 2019

Great view and a great swim in the rooftop pool. The most expensive swim I've ever had.
Elevators very fast. Quiet. Great view of the gardens. Subway station leads right into the mall which leads into the lobby. Subway in Singapore cheap, clean, air conditioned and fast - much better than taking a cab.
Staff excellent in their custom made uniforms.

For example, the mini bar was locked and we got 2 small bottles of water. Also, I managed to bypass the $200 deposit but what an insane amount!

The staff who checked us in (Mary Jane) was really friendly as well.","Hard to find any negatives, maybe the hotel menu on the TV screen wasn’t the most straightforward.

No free stuff, no fruits/wine in room etc, whole minibar is extra charged, notging is included. This is what you call a top level 5* hotel? 
On check-in we've been driven to a wrong entrance (tower3) there's check-in counter, but no one around, you have to call to get info where to go (tower1), had to go through the whole building, your luggage? Nobody cares because there's just too much people.
Want breakfast? Pay extra $105 for 2, and the offer is a decent 4*, nothing extraordinary. Moreover we were seated on a super uncomfortable stool with no backrest and below knees leveled table, which made our breakfast a some kind of stretch practice.

We worked out that if we went up to the pool floor (57) walked along to the lifts and down to 55 and the restaurant.

We were upgraded to a 30th floor room with a view to the front of the hotel. We arrived to our room just in time to view the nightly light show and all we did was sit in front of the large floor to ceiling windows and watch the beautiful show!
Fabulous amenities and so many shopping and food options at the Marina Bay Shoppes, you don't have to leave the premises.  My absolute favorite was the rooftop pool on the 57th floor with a spectacular view of Singapore. At night you can see the Gardens by the Bay lit up in all its glory from the rooftop. There's also a bar and Spago restaurant on the rooftop with the same great view of the city. 
A trip to Singapore would not be complete without a trip to Gardens by the Bay, just a short walking distance next to the hotel. We visited a week before Christmas and the Gardens had Christmas displays, plus the nightly light show was set to Christmas music. It was a magical experience walking on the elevated bridge, the trees lit up in various colors and changing to the beat of the music! 
We stayed 3 days prior to our cruise and it was less then a 10 min taxi ride to the port. So convenient to be that close to the port, and no worries about getting there on time.

Upside: (1) 14 minutes of good walking, (2) saved enough money for two more meals; lunch and dinner in many delicious Singaporean foodcourts.","The Sands is like a Central train station. Huge with absolutely no personalities. Personal service.....unthinkable. You try to walk around ""your"" hotel and realised that the lobby has a chockfull of people otherwise (from appearance) not belong to the hotel. Just a massively busy lobby. Check-in, check-out, concierge, bellman lines are all incredibly long. And this was post-Christmas (our stay dates 26th thru 29th), can you imagine New Year or Chinese New Year peak days?

The free water and apples are a nice touch.,We had a few days lay over in Singapore and decided to treat ourselves to the famous Marina Bay Sands.  Well let me start by saying that this hotel is a total Tourist Trap.  It is not worth the top dollar price you pay per night unless you want bragging rights.  The lobby is jam packed full of tourists taking photo's of every little corner of the hotel and if you want breakfast at one of the restaurants on the 57th floor be prepared to stand in a very long Q and wait.  The rooms are nice and big but I personally do not think it is worth the hefty price tag.  The minibar is jam packed full of product so there is no space for you to store the free water they give you in the room to keep it cold.  I think in a few years time this hotel will start to look drab and worn as the volume of tourists coming through their doors are substantial. Be prepared to have the infinity pool crowded most of the day. I would personally book into a hotel opposite the Marina Bay Sands and enjoy the light show every night instead of staying in the hotel itself.,Kevin,South Africa,December 2018

Finally. Getting to Gardens By The Bay is ridiculously complicated considering the bridge to the gardens goes through the hotel!

When we finally got the maintenance guy he informed us that the filter was not clean he sorted this then no issues but I think that given the nights sleep lost the hotel didn't really seem to care and when mentioned at check out they didn't really care either - upshot I'll tell as many people as I can not to stay there and will repeat this review on as many forums as possible",Mandie Mrs D,United Kingdom,October 2018

1580,28 October 2018,Biggest rip-off,5.4,"The only attraction really is the roof top swimming pool, period.","Among a few other attractions to visit Singapore – a stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was a dream too.
We thought we could write raving review about that iconic building and our memorable stay in the lap of luxury.  It turned out to be a bad dream that one never want to experience a second time.
To start with we do not consider this hotel as a luxury offering, not even up to 5 star standards of other hotels in Singapore or elsewhere. 
The level of communicative English of customer service employees was very poor.  The amenities provided as toiletries etc. were of cheap quality, the shower (instead of a rain shower) was a low pressure mist spray rather than shower. There was not even a hand shower. When we complained the reception seems to be ignorant what A RAIN SHOWER OR A HAND SHOWER is. To our utter surprise they sent us plastic water buckets (which apparently is their common solution to this complaint). Please see the photos. When we asked for room with proper shower or bath tub they offered to shift us to handicapped room or bring a child plastic bath tub.  
It is lack of professionalism that the Hotel Management did not realise (if they have then did not communicate with the guests) the noise and disturbance that could be caused by the Singapore Ladies Run around 5:00 am on 13th October at the Gardens by the Bay. When we complained about the high decibel noise on our 44th floor, the reception offered to speak to the neighbors. They should have known the noise was from outside. The noise through loud speakers woke up many guests, each comically blaming the next room neighbor (we personally went to their door and disturbed them thinking they were causing the noise).  WHAT A PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT, AND AT A PRICE THAT IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN SINGAPORE.
We requests guests planning to stay here to be aware.

Central location","Hotel is extremely overpriced - Room facilities basic and ""automated"" mini bar is extremely annoying. No facilities to place your own food/drinks into a fridge (Extra fridge is available at extra cost and we are already paying over S$700.0 per night!!). Fittings in poor condition - power points not functioning properly with sockets popping out. Check in process is extremely clumsy and time consuming. We booked a garden room and we given a city view room (not a major problem but another example of lack of attention to their customers needs). One site restaurants expensive. There are many better priced hotels in the Marina Bay area and we would suggest anyone contemplating booking here does their research into other options before booking this place.",Ray,Australia,October 2018

But both not worth the money that they ask for.","This hotel has two major issues, 1) the aircon in the room is very loud and cannot be configured to any setting that is acceptable from a noise perspective, it was hard to fall asleep, 2) there are WAY to few check-in counters for a hotel of this size which leads to huge queues. Checkin can take more than one hour (which you spend waiting in line with hundred other guests) if you arrive at crunch time!
Both of these points are simply not acceptable for a hotel of this price range.

1682,26 September 2018,Okay for two days,7.5,"Beautiful property. We stayed for 5 nights. Through booking.com we booked two different room under two different deals. The first deal was great as we got a club room (suite) with access to the lounge which is totally worth it. The suites are very big and spacious and really keep the property and room clean.  Staff are very helpful and all speak english. The lounge is totally worth it if you can get it included in the package as the food in the lounge and unlimited alcohol (5 to 7pm, happy hour) is great. You can watch the sunset so get there early for 5pm to get a good seat by the window. 
The property has 4 breakfast lounges - the main one is not good but the other three smaller ones (including the lounge) is way better. 
Laser show off the property at night is totally worth it, check with the front desk for times. Many site seeing sites are just off the property or you can take the Metro that's attached to the hotel and easy to get around. (Not sure why pics are sideways as they appear straight on my viewer, sorry)","For the other three nights stay, we didnt get a club room (suite) through booking.com so we upgraded our room so we didnt have to move from one room to another. The extra bed for $150 for my child was expensive. We found out there was a pull out couch in our suite so we were happy with it as the staff comes to set up the bed every night with sheets so we ended up saving $150 every night - even though they tried to sell the $150 with free access to the lounge and breakfast for my child but paying individually is still cheaper. 
I am south Asian, i didnt expect a southasian chef at breakfast but the food was cooked in mass, and it was not impressive. For a 5 star luxury hotel (we payed closed to $5000) for 5 nights and we expected beautiful breakfast and found it disappointing the main breakfast room was just another typical buffet large breakfast -nothing special. I expected more since its supposed to be a luxury hotel. I spoke to the dining room manager and the next day he brought a special breakfast for us at the club lounge but it was brought half hour later than their promised time as my child couldnt wait so she ate whatever was available at the lounge.  
The infinity roof top pool is awesome to look at but its filled with 100s of people who just want to take selfies - and its super warm and it felt more like a giant hot tub and hard to find a lounge chair as they let so many people in and people walk around in circles looking for a chair. 
The hotel is worth it if you really get a good deal, but I wouldn't recommend a longer stay as the place feels more like Disney World or a Resort as its just a funny things to do and hang around, with the hotel being the attraction. You dont really get the value when you pay so much money and you have to fight for everything as it doesnt feel like a 5-star hotel because there are so many people staying there, everything you  have to wait or lineup.

Good location for an easy walk into the gardens which were beautiful, the satay bar in the gardens is great too. It was good to have an adults only section of the pool too.

Cost of beer is obscene! >$10 USD for 330 mls. Understand hotel prices are always higher, but that’s ridiculous. Can’t use the minibar for your own items either unless you pay a fee. Get an ice bucket and BYO. The balconies on garden side are small, with no ability to sit outside in privacy and enjoy the view, which is a shame as theres nowhere else that isnt busy.

It is best to see the Gardens by the Bay light show from in amongst the trees, rather than from your room or the observation deck, but the event plaza light show is fine to view from your room, if you are on that side.  The hop on hop off bus stops outside the hotel and you can pay the driver, so you don't need to find a ticket office.

I liked that it was not as busy as I expected and there was plenty of space around the pool area to relax comfortably.","I feel Marina Bay Sands is actually a victim of it's own success. The pool is a huge draw, the prospect of being the next top instagram model has actually really ruined the customer experience (note experience not service) of this hotel. Let me elaborate without sounding like a have a go hero.
1. When you stay at a 5* hotel, success to me is measured by the hotels ability to transport you away from a hectic lifestyle, busy city, stressful life and instantly make you feel like you are in a Zen, peaceful and relaxing environment, Service that makes you feel important, scents that ignite your senses and high end furnishing that bring out that inner elite feeling (we all have it) is to me what 5* is.  Unfortunately due to the size of the Marina Bay Sands, the lobby area is a frenzy of activity. Your senses are heightened and you are left feeling a little overwhelmed. This is your first impression, and you don't get a second chance to make a first impressions. It was a little bit of a swarm, people asking to take your bags, huge queues to check-in, people jumping in and out of the line, your bags disappearing, staff trying their best to appease hot and flustered guests, eager to get to the pool and start taking the 'original gram.' I would ask your staff to walk into the Fullerton/ Fullerton Bay hotel to better understand this.
2. The rooms are very basic in their furnishings, does not scream 5* quality. The volume of guests staying here is showing in the decor, very tired, scuffed walls, flimsy switches and lacking the 'wow factor' other hotels close by offer. When I stay at a hotel, and maybe it is just me, but the power of the shower is always a huge selling point. If the hotel room has a rain shower that brings you back to life after a long flight...then it is a winner. I suspect that due to the size of the Marina Bay Sands, the water pressure of the showers is not sustainable to support a Rain shower.",Andrew,United Kingdom,August 2018

* Our room had comfy beds, was extremely clean, and very spacious. The shower facilities were fantastic.
* The staff are all friendly and attentive if you have a question or need help with anything.
* Their Club 55 is really good. If you pay a set amount you can go in there and have a buffet of food/drink at allocated times.
* Room view was fantastic. The infinity pool view is breathtaking, and so are the views from Club 55.
* Location is perfect, it's right next to everything else in the centre of Singapore.
* We were made to feel like King and Queens
* We liked just about everything","* If you are going up to the infinity pool, be prepared to see a lot of people taking up space in the pool to take selfies - it is an extremely posy place and this unfortunately cannot be escaped!!!
* Also be prepared for people to ask you to take pictures of them (this can however be used as an advantage to get others to take pictures of you with your phone)
* Dress code is a bit more expectant compared to other nearby 5* hotels, and this isn't clear right from the beginning - so if your the kind of person who wants to dress down, you may be disappointed by some of the stricter dress codes. Just be prepared to pack posh clothes so that you can meet their requirements and look your best throughout the stay.
* Some members of staff seemed maxed out, I guess this is due to MBS being a massively popular resort, so in terms of how much time staff members spend time with you and chat, it is much rarer to be approached by staff members on how your stay is going compared to other nearby 5* hotels. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, just something to be mindful of during the stay. The service is still excellent, but staff are at more of an arms length when compared to hotels like Pan Pacific or the Marina Mandarin. But they don't have quite the same turnout of customers that MBS gets.
* MBS is a massive resort as opposed to a hotel - getting around it can prove daunting and takes time. After checking in, we felt as though we still needed a bit more of an understanding of where certain restaurants and facilities were, as we only stayed for 2 nights. Me and my partner feel there needs to be more navigation and mapping around the hotel to enable people to find where their way around.",Daniel,United Kingdom,June 2018

Yes the views are amazing and the pool is awesome, but it’s so big that you lose the exclusivity of being a hotel guest. Much like some of the larger hotels in Dubai for example, they should really consider having ‘guest only’ areas, especially in the lobby where anyone can walk through (including large tour groups).

I have never felt so bad in a hotel as in Marina Bay Sands. If you are looking for a luxury experience, escape from this resort. Problems started at check in - huge queues, slow staff. I booked a room for three people, arriving in the room I had to wait an hour for them to come and readapt the room for three people - something unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. The room should be ready to accommodate guests who arrive tired from a trip! Everything looks cheap... The beautiful lobby of the hotel looks like a train station at peak times. There are no places to sit and wait. The hotel does not differentiate guests from tourists!!!!!!!! The intense circulation of people makes you feel insecure... So you always feel through crowds and very stressed. The breakfast is not included, and costs absurd 35+ dollars !!! In the deluxe room, no fruit or snacks - just a crowded fridge with automatic sensor - if u touch one item, you pay for it. You cannot even freeze your own items. The pool is crowded, as in a public club, and the chairs are always all occupied with towels, so you have trouble finding two chairs together to relax with your partner. If you are planning a quiet holiday, this hotel is not the right choice. Everything is paid for - and the prices are exorbitant. We paid a very high price and had no comfort in these days of lodging. On the contrary; stress from arrival to departure, a slow check-out, a huge queue, and after complaining about the list of problems encountered in my stay, we received only a ""Sorry"" from the attendant.

This hotel really has the wow factor to look at and i am thrilled that I had the opportunity to stay here. Drinks at the pool are reasonably priced for this hotel and the views are stunning.,"The staff were efficient but because they are so busy it can take the personal touch away from the service. The fridge in the hotel room is based on sensors, so if you even remove drinks to have a look or to put your own drinks in there you are charged, even if you have not consumed the drinks. Luckily we went straight to reception and they removed this from our bill.

Although we enjoyed the experience of the world famous infinity pool and the general location of the premises, the rest of the experience was somewhat of a disappointment. upon arrival we were allowed to check in early which was greatly received however, on entering our room we discovered house keeping had failed to properly clean the bathroom facilities. Lifting the toilet seat we were greeted by fresh excrement which was heavily soiling the bowl. The other disappointing part of our stay was the location of our room above a restaurant in tower 2. Each night we were kept awake until 2am in the morning because of excessive noise coming from the restaurant. After the first night we received a curtesy call from the hotel and upon explaining our predicament it became quite clear it was a known problem and rather than offering a solution we were told we could check out 2 hours later on the last day.

We enjoyed  a long day at the pools sky view, from 9:30am till late afternoon and returned again in the evening to check the observation deck and the view from the pools. Lovely hot Jacuzzi, very nice atmosphere at night, we had very good weather, not too hot. You need to use sun cream even if the sky looks overcast as we got burnt in our 5h stay by the pools.
If the weather is windy, or raining, please be aware they might close the top floor with the swimming pool and observation deck. If you stay only one night, check the weather prior booking.
The best to enjoy a maximum use of the place, is if you arrive early morning as they will allow you access to the pool floor even if they don't have a room ready to give you. Next day after the check out at 12noon they don't allow you access to any of their facilities for the guests which needed to check out.

The 3 towers are connected at the base and not too long end to end (roughly a 3-5 min walk). We checked in at the tower 1 side (which had a longer line). Our room was the cheapest, but the check in staff was so kind and upgraded us to the orchard suite. Later in our room we found a Happy anniversary cake. The hotel has easy access to the gardens, too. As well as tons of shopping (+ late night food court), and of course casino if that's your thing. Our favorite was of course the rooftop infinity pool.

It’s probably not a place to stay for 2 weeeks but a nice weekend stay can be reasonably priced considering that this is a 5* place and just one of the most beautiful hotels of the world.
Also, pretty much every celebrity chef restaurant is located in MBS so plenty of choices if you want to go to a super fancy place for dinner",Checkin/checkout is slow. MBS needs more desks for this.

He said the hotel was busy with guests but when I spoke to another staff member she said there weren't as many guests staying at the hotel at that time and that the infinity pool shouldn't be over-crowded.

They offered an early check in but in a room with 2 separe beds and view over to the street. The rest is what you would expect from a hotel of this class.,Some of the staff didn’t speak good English which I think is a must have for such hotel. The service at the pool was terrible.

However we were offered 2 restaurants at a price that was in excess of $50 ++ per head. FOR BREAKFAST, no one eats that much food for breakfast. 
I also found that the drink prices around the pool to be excessive, if the price was a bit more reasonable, people would consume a bit more whilst there.
The fridge in the room was so full we could not get our own drinks in it, some people have their own drinks they need to keep cold, and medication for that matter.

Our last night, we even received a complimentary bottle of wine, chocolates, personalized towel and a handwritten note from our concierge thanking us for our stay.  She even remembered why we were there and wished my husband a happy birthday in her note, and said she looked forward to meeting our children next time we were there.

Regarding the rooms, we were lucky enough to stay in two of them and I have to say, the difference is kind of big. The more expensive room had way more space, was better arranged and an even better view. The smaller a.k.a. normal room was pretty average and for me definitely not worth the price. So, more expensive room - wow, normal room - meh :) In any case, the infinity pool makes up for everything, a truly unforgettable experience.",Some of the rooms are connected with the adjacent room through a door.

Truly an amazing lifetime experience per se. One night is more than enough just to get the privilege of swimming there, and the hotel ownership knows this. We had free early check-in at 6am and free late check-out (13:00) the next day, which were greatly appreciated. Reception staff was very professional and accomodating. Thanks.","Massive  hotel, feels like a factory. Rooms were very conventional ""American"" style... lacking ""heart"". There was a very bad sewage smell in the bathroom of our room (the reception offered us, and we accepted, to change room and 100 Singapore Dollars credit to spent at the Hotel - breakfast). Some of the electrical appliances did not work and maintenance/electrician had to be called in. Overall, for a Hotel of such calibre (and price) this was unacceptable poor maintenance.

The elevators can be very annoying because not all floors give you a light to indicate which of the 6 doors will open and by the time you figure out which elevator to get on it has already left and you have to wait awhile for another one to come. Another downside is the pool can get very crowded throughout the day, but at least there is an adult only area.",Rose,USA,March 2018

2412,17 March 2018,Spectacular pool makes it worth the price,9.2,"- The pool is amazing and exceeded my expectations. Being allowed to use it is what just about makes this place value for money. I expected it to be busy but the adults only section of the pool wasn’t too bad at all - within a few minutes there was always a spot with enough space for a nice picture by the edge. The adults only section was well enforced too. The part for famailes did look a lot more manic however.. 
- The bed and pillows were amazing, so so comfortable. Room (King Size Delxue) was very clean. The shower was very good.
- Overall I would highly recommend doing a short stay here. For the price, without the pool, it would not be value for money. But considering you do get to use the spectacular pool, that is what makes it worth it.","- Do bare in mind when considering a stay here the prices of food and drink which are very expensive. (It is Singapore after all I guess).
- One of the male bar staff at the Ce La Vi bar (in the club section) was very rude. The bar wasn’t even busy at all but he looked offended and stressed when I dared to make an order for just two drinks, and he was just very moody and impolite. He was visibly annoyed when I asked if it was possible to put the drinks onto our room tab which wasn’t possible. Whilst he was pouring my beer, another lady who had lost her bank card came to the bar to ask if anything had been handed in - and he literally just waved her away and looked at her in disgust. I’ve never seen anything like it. (All other staff at the hotel were great)
- It can feel impersonal staying here because of its sheer size, but that didn’t really bother us too much.
- We booked on booking.com very far in advance and requested as high a room as possible. Ended up pretty low down as it was explained that I’d only reserved (albeit with credit card guarantee) and not paid in full - so I was only allocated a room on checking in by which time higher ones had been taken. Hardly the end of the world as you have use of the pool for the views, but, if I’d known this I would’ve paid in advance. So just bare this in mind if you are looking for a higher room when booking.",Rb719,United Kingdom,March 2018

Access via tower 1 - then we learnt later that we could if accessed via tower 3 by changing lifts - but club lounge was only via tower 2 - are you confused - yep so were we - not sure why club rooms are not located in tower 2 for heaven sake - club facilities and evening cocktails excellent - staff in club lounge were probably the worst if the staff

Great location to go discover the gardens everything walking distance.  We only used one restaurant up the top floor and pool area, very expensive for a shared hamburger, chips and a couple of beers  totalled SD$100 , but the view was a million dollars.

The mini bar has a little sensor where if you remove an item from the minibar it will automatically charge to your credit card (we didn’t touch the mini-bar and got charged for 3 items for both rooms).

Tried to charge us alot more on arrival..about 2k sgd. 
Rooms werent well insulated from noise. I was by the lift and it was noisy with the alert from the lift when arriving at the floor. The room rate was charged incorrectly and although finally corrected it took 3 different people to resolve over the course of the stay. Booking.com did call up to also apologise aftercheck out. The safe in my colleagues room proved to be faulty. His tv didnt work. My friend left something for me at concierge and it was not noted on the system to collect on checkout. By that time i had already arrived at the airport and so drove back only to be told that they couldn't find the item. (My friend had also queued for 20 minutes to deliver the item) Irrespective of its value it was a complete shambles. When it rained at the pool area the restaurant spago was closed to new guests because of rain and it was supposedly slippery - although people were moving around freely inside the restaurant (floor was dry where people were sitting - i.e. away from the balcony area) and there was also free seating away from the wet. We ended up eating in ce la vie and it was wet in the outdoor area which was open to public. Go figure on alternative health and safety policies - policy entirely confused?

I loved the New Years decorations, and the front desk staff was professional and kind.","Honestly, for the price i payed for the room for one person - I thought the room would have been larger and more spectacular. I loved the view, but I was quite disappointed. The bed was so uncomfortable; that was surprising also. There wasn't even a tub in it. I thought I had booked a ""suite"" with a view, but it really seems like a standard room with a view. The pictures of what I saw for this when booking did NOT look the same; a suite typically goes beyond the bed, bath, desk, and a chair. I thought I'd be able to SIT ON THE BALCONY also, but no....it was tiny.  The hallway on the 45th floor smelled terrible; I have no idea what it was, but I did not smell it on any other floor I stopped on. The pool was magnificent, but to get a chair, I had to go at 630 am. There was NOTHING open in the afternoon, and I walked around for 20 minutes the second day before I saw someone get up who actually took care of their towels and left a seat open. As a paying customer staying in the hotel, we should have priority to seats at the pool - honestly. It was the biggest selling point.
The restaurants were great. Although, they forgot my order for food and missed a drink order - maybe the server just didn't understand, I do not know; this was at the Spago bar location on the final evening I was there. I will give them this, they responded well when they I reminded them - I received apologies from three people directly including the manager, and they removed it from my check. They still missed the drink though, so I just ordered something different.
It was difficult to navigate to some locations - I asked three people about the evening light show and where to go to see it, and it took three to get a kind an helpful answer. A woman at the elevator bay kindly provided it; the other two blew me off as if I was bothering them. I did not appreciate that at all.",Jacquelyn,United Arab Emirates,February 2018
